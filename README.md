## Overview
This project is a responsive website that allows users to search for GIFs using the Giphy API. Users can enter a keyword, submit a search request, and view the returned GIFs displayed in a responsive grid layout. The project also includes a bonus Rock Paper Scissors game page to demonstrate additional JavaScript functionality and user interaction.

The site supports multiple visual themes (Default, Pastel, and Dark), which are saved using localStorage to persist user preferences between sessions.
