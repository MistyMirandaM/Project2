GIF Search & Rock Paper Scissors Game

First and foremost, this project is a website dedicated to searching GIFs using the Giphy API. Users can search for GIFs by keyword and view results instantly on the page. The site also includes a simple Rock Paper Scissors game to demonstrate how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive features.

The project focuses on clean design, beginner-friendly JavaScript logic, and user experience. It also includes theme switching, allowing users to choose between a default, pastel, or dark theme that stays consistent across pages.
